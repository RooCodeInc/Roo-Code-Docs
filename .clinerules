# Roo Code Documentation Rules

## Documentation Links
- Do not include .md extensions in documentation links
- Use relative paths for internal documentation links
- Example: [link text](basic-usage/how-tools-work) NOT [link text](basic-usage/how-tools-work.md)

This ensures links work correctly in the built documentation while maintaining clean URLs.
