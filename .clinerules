# Roo Code Documentation Rules

## Documentation Links
- Do not include .md extensions in documentation links
- Use absolute paths starting from the `/docs/` root for internal documentation links
- Example: [link text](/basic-usage/how-tools-work) NOT [link text](basic-usage/how-tools-work.md) or [link text](../../basic-usage/how-tools-work)

This ensures links work correctly in the built documentation while maintaining clean URLs.
