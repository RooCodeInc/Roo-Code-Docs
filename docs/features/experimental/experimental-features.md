# Experimental Features

Roo Code includes experimental features that are still under development.  These features may be unstable, change significantly, or be removed in future versions.  Use them with caution and be aware that they may not work as expected.

**Warning:** Experimental features may have unexpected behavior, including potential data loss or security vulnerabilities.  Enable them at your own risk.

## Enabling Experimental Features

1.  Open the Roo Code settings (<Codicon name="gear" /> icon in the top right corner).
2.  Go to the "Advanced Settings" section.
3.  Find the "Experimental Features" section.
4.  Check or uncheck the boxes for the features you want to enable or disable.
5.  Click "Done" to save your changes.

## Current Experimental Features

The following experimental features are currently available:

### Search and Replace

Adds a new tool for searching and replacing text in a file.

### Insert Content

Adds a new tool for inserting content at any position in a file.

### Power Steering

When enabled, Roo will remind the model about the details of its current mode definition more frequently. This will lead to stronger adherence to role definitions and custom instructions, but will use more tokens per message.
