This patch release includes minor updates to provider configurations.

## General and QOL Improvements

*   **Provider Profiles Schema:** The JSON schema validation for provider profiles has been relaxed. This provides greater flexibility when configuring custom or less common provider setups and reduces potential validation errors for valid configurations. Telemetry related to provider usage has also been added to help diagnose issues.
