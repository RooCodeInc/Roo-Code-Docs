# Roo Code 3.3.25 Release Notes (2025-02-21)

This release introduces the Debug mode and an experimental "Power Steering" option.

## Feature Highlights

*   **Debug Mode:** Added a new "Debug" mode specializing in diagnosing and fixing tricky problems. (thanks Ted Werbel, Carlos E. Perez!)
*   **Experimental Power Steering:** Added an optional "Power Steering" setting to improve model adherence to role definitions and custom instructions by more frequently reminding the model of its current mode details (uses additional tokens). Enable via the checkbox at the bottom of the main settings view.
