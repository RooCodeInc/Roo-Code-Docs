# Roo Code 3.7.5 Release Notes (2025-02-26)

This release includes important updates to model configuration for thinking models and bug fixes.

## Model Configuration Updates

*   **Thinking Model Versions:** Introduced separate `:thinking` versions for Anthropic and OpenRouter Sonnet 3.7 models to support configurable thinking budgets. Users previously using the thinking feature need to select these new model versions in their provider settings and adjust the thinking budget slider as needed.

## Bug Fixes

*   Fixed context window calculation errors ("input length and max_tokens exceed context limit").
*   Fixed various issues with the model picker UI. (thanks System233!)
*   Fixed model input/output cost parsing. (thanks System233!)

## Feature Highlights

*   Added the ability to @-mention files by holding Shift while dragging them from the File Explorer into the chat input.
