# Roo Code 3.0 Release Notes (2025-02-27)

This release cycle marked the introduction of Chat Modes in Roo Code, allowing users to interact with the AI for architectural discussions and codebase questions without immediately diving into code generation. It also included some minor fixes and updates.
