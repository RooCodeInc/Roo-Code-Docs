# Roo Code 3.11.0 Release Notes (2025-03-30)

This release introduces faster diff editing, project-level MCP configuration, API key balance display, improved Gemini integration, settings import/export, API profile pinning/sorting, editable suggested answers, and numerous other enhancements and bug fixes.

## Fast Edits (Multi-Block Diffs)

Roo Code's default editing mechanism now uses a multi-block diff strategy for the [`apply_diff`](/advanced-usage/available-tools/apply-diff) tool. This is significantly faster, especially when applying multiple changes at once, as it modifies only the necessary lines instead of rewriting the entire file. This leads to quicker edits and helps prevent issues like truncated writes on large files.

## Project-Level MCP Config

MCP (Mode Communication Protocol) server configurations can now be defined at the project or workspace level using a `.roo/mcp.json` file within your project's root directory. This allows for tailored MCP setups specific to different projects and takes precedence over global MCP settings. (Thanks aheizi!)

## API Key Balances

You can now conveniently check your current credit balance for OpenRouter and Requesty directly within the Roo Code API provider settings.

## Improved Gemini Support

*   **Smarter Retry Logic:** More intelligent handling of transient Gemini API issues, including rate limits and error responses.
*   **Improved Character Escaping:** Resolved issues with character escaping for more accurate code generation.
*   **Gemini 2.5 Pro Support:** Added support for Gemini 2.5 Pro model via GCP Vertex AI. (Thanks nbihan-mediware!)

## Settings Management

*   **Import/Export Settings:** Export your Roo Code settings to a JSON file for backup/sharing, and import settings to merge configurations.
*   **Pin and Sort API Profiles:** Pin favorite API profiles to the top and sort the list in the settings dropdown. (Thanks jwcraig!)
