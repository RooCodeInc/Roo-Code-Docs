# Roo Code 3.7.3 Release Notes (2025-02-25)

This release introduces support for Claude Sonnet 3.7's extended "Thinking" capability via the Anthropic API.

## Feature Highlights

*   **Extended "Thinking" Support:** Added support for extended ["Thinking"](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking) with Claude Sonnet 3.7 via the Anthropic provider. This allows the model to allocate more tokens to internal reasoning for complex tasks, potentially improving response quality. (thanks cte!)
