# Roo Code 3.16 Release Notes (2025-05-06)

This release introduces vertical tab navigation for settings, new API providers (Groq and Chutes), clickable code references, and numerous UI/UX enhancements, alongside various bug fixes and miscellaneous improvements.

## Total Settings Navigation Overhaul (thanks @dlab-anton!)
FINALLY the settings interface has been revamped with a new vertical tab layout for a more efficient and intuitive experience:
- **Effortless One-Click Access**: Navigate between settings sections with a single click.
- **Optimized for Your Workspace**: Vertical tabs adapt to your VS Code sidebar width, showing full labels or compact icons with tooltips.
- **Improved Layout and Clarity**: Settings are organized in a clear vertical list for better visibility.
- **Modernized Look and Feel**: Provides a contemporary and user-friendly way to manage extension settings.

## Clickable Code References in Chat (thanks @KJ7LNW!)
Navigating code discussed in AI responses is now significantly easier:
- **Clickable Code and Filenames**: Any `code` or `filename.extension()` mentioned by the AI is now a clickable link.
- **Jump to Specific Lines**: Links open the relevant file in your editor and navigate directly to the referenced line number.
- **Streamlined Code Exploration**: Quickly move from AI explanations to the exact spot in your codebase.

## Continued UI/UX Improovements (thanks @elianiva!)
General UI improvements for a more consistent, visually appealing, and intuitive experience:
- **Visually Unified Design**: A more consistent look and feel across settings, prompt interactions, and mode selections.
- **Improved Theme Adaptability**: Better consistency across different VS Code themes.
- **Streamlined Interactions**: Tidied up UI elements like mode selection and prompt enhancement areas.
- **Modernized Icons and Tooltips for Code Blocks**: Code block controls (copy, wrap, expand/collapse) now use crisp Lucide icons and feature translated tooltips for better accessibility.
