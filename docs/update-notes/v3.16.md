# Roo Code 3.16 Release Notes

*These release notes include all the improvements from v3.16.x. Last updated with 3.16.0 on 2025-05-06*

This release introduces vertical tab navigation for settings, new API providers (Groq and Chutes), clickable code references, and numerous UI/UX enhancements, alongside various bug fixes and miscellaneous improvements.

## Gemini Model and Caching Updates
- The `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06` model is now available for [Vertex](/providers/vertex) and [Google Gemini](/providers/gemini) providers. Users of the older `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25` will automatically benefit from this newer model, as the previous ID now aliases to the latest version on Google's backend. No configuration changes are needed. (thanks @zetaloop!)
- Prompt caching is now enabled by default for supported Gemini models on the [Vertex](/providers/vertex) and [Google Gemini](/providers/gemini) providers, leading to:
    - **Faster Responses for Repeated Queries**: Gemini remembers previous similar prompts.
    - **Reduced API Usage**: Minimizes redundant API calls.
    - **Simplified Experience with Opt-Out Control**: Active out-of-the-box, but can be disabled in settings.

## Total Settings Navigation Overhaul (thanks @dlab-anton!)

FINALLY the settings interface has been revamped with a new vertical tab layout for a more efficient and intuitive experience
    - **One-Click Access:** Navigate between settings sections with a single click via the new vertical tabs in the settings view.
    - **Improved Layout and Clarity:** Settings are now organized in a clear vertical list for better visibility.

## MCP Service Improvements

    - MCP server errors are now captured and shown in a new "Errors" tab (thanks @robertheadley!)
    - Error logging will no longer break MCP functionality if the server is properly connected (thanks @ksze!)

## Clickable Code References in Chat (thanks @KJ7LNW!)

Navigating code discussed in AI responses is now significantly easier:
    - **Clickable Code and Filenames**: Any `code` or `filename.extension()` mentioned by the AI is now a clickable link.
    - **Jump to Specific Lines**: Links open the relevant file in your editor and navigate directly to the referenced line number.
    - **Streamlined Code Exploration**: Quickly move from AI explanations to the exact spot in your codebase.

## Continued UI/UX Improvements (thanks @elianiva!)

General UI improvements for a more consistent, visually appealing, and intuitive experience:
    - **Visually Unified Design**: A more consistent look and feel across settings, prompt interactions, and mode selections.
    - **Improved Theme Adaptability**: Better consistency across different VS Code themes.
    - **Streamlined Interactions**: Tidied up UI elements like mode selection and prompt enhancement areas.
    - **Modernized Icons and Tooltips for Code Blocks**: Code block controls (copy, wrap, expand/collapse) now use crisp Lucide icons and feature translated tooltips for better accessibility.
