# Roo Code 3.12.0 Release Notes (2025-04-15)

This release introduces xAI provider support, improves diff editing, enhances UI with search capabilities, and includes various usability improvements and bug fixes.

## Provider Updates

*   Added xAI provider and exposed reasoning effort options for Grok on OpenRouter. (thanks Cline!)

## Keyboard Shortcuts

### Keyboard Shortcuts for Input Acceptance

Added the `roo.acceptInput` command to allow users to accept input or suggestions using keyboard shortcuts instead of mouse clicks. (thanks axkirillov!) This feature:

#### Key Benefits

* **Keyboard-Driven Interface**: Submit text or select the primary suggestion button without mouse interaction
* **Improved Accessibility**: Essential for users with mobility limitations or those who experience discomfort with mouse usage
* **Vim/Neovim Compatibility**: Supports seamless transitions for developers coming from keyboard-centric environments
* **Workflow Efficiency**: Reduces context switching between keyboard and mouse during development tasks

#### Technical Implementation

* Command registered as `roo.acceptInput` with display title "Roo: Accept Input/Suggestion"
* Designed to work with the `rooViewFocused` context condition
* No default key binding - users can assign their preferred shortcut
* Works in conjunction with other keyboard shortcuts for a complete keyboard-driven experience

For detailed setup and usage instructions, see our new [Keyboard Shortcuts](/features/keyboard-shortcuts) documentation page.

## Improvements

*   Made diff editing configuration per-profile and improved pre-diff string normalization for better editing reliability.
*   Made checkpoints faster and more reliable for smoother project state management.
*   Added a search bar to mode and profile select dropdowns for easier navigation. (thanks samhvw8!)
*   Added telemetry for code action usage, prompt enhancement usage, and consecutive mistake errors to improve product stability.
*   Suppressed zero cost values in the task header for cleaner UI. (thanks do-it!)
*   Made JSON parsing safer to avoid crashing the webview on bad input.
