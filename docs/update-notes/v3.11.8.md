# Roo Code 3.11.8 Release Notes (2025-04-08)

This patch release includes performance improvements and UI updates.

## Introduction of `.roorules` Files

*   Added support for `.roorules` files (e.g., `.roorules` for workspace-wide, `.roorules-code` for mode-specific) as a way to manage custom instructions directly within your project. This provides an alternative to defining instructions solely within the extension's settings UI. A deprecation warning for the older `.clinerules` file was also added. (Thanks upamune!)
*   Learn more about [Custom Instructions](/features/custom-instructions) and how this applies to [Custom Modes](/features/custom-modes).
## Changes

*   Improved `combineApiRequests` performance to reduce gray screens of death (thanks kyle-apex!).
*   Added searchable dropdown to API config profiles on the settings screen (thanks samhvw8!).
*   Added workspace tracking to history items in preparation for future filtering (thanks samhvw8!).
## Bug Fixes

*   Fixed search highlighting UI in history search (thanks samhvw8!).
*   Fixed nodejs version format in `.tool-versions` file (thanks upamune!).
