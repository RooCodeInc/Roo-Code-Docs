# Roo Code 3.14.2 Release Notes (2025-04-24)

This release introduces prompt caching for Gemini, user control over caching for specific models on OpenRouter, improved terminal output handling, and adds Russian language support.

## Gemini 2.5 Caching is HERE!

*   **Prompt Caching for Gemini 2.5 Models:** Prompt caching is now available for supported Google Gemini 2.5 models when using the [Requesty](/providers/requesty), [Google Gemini](/providers/gemini), or [OpenRouter](/providers/openrouter) providers.
*   **Manual Caching Toggle (Google Gemini & OpenRouter Only):**
    *   For the **[Google Gemini](/providers/gemini)** and **[OpenRouter](/providers/openrouter)** providers specifically, a new checkbox allows you to manually enable prompt caching for supported Gemini 2.5 models.
        <img src="/img/v3.14.2/v3.14.2.png" alt="Prompt Caching Checkbox in Provider Settings" width="600" />
    *   **Why the checkbox?** This setting is provided as a temporary workaround for potential response delays sometimes observed with Google's caching mechanism when accessed via these two providers. Caching is *not* enabled by default for them.
    *   **Requesty:** Caching remains automatic for supported models via Requesty.

## Terminal Improvements

*   Improved handling of terminal output containing backspace characters for cleaner display (thanks KJ7LNW!).

## Internationalization: Russian Language Added

*   Added Russian language support (Спасибо asychin!).
