# Roo Code 3.7.8 Release Notes (2025-02-27)

This release adds support for GPT-4.5 Preview, Claude optimizations, and an advanced system prompt customization feature.

## Provider & Model Support

*   Added support for `gpt-4.5-preview`.
*   Added Vertex AI prompt caching support for Claude models. (thanks aitoroses, lupuletic!)

## Advanced Feature

*   **Custom System Prompts (Advanced Users Only):** Added the ability to completely replace the system prompt for modes by creating a file at `.roo/system-prompt-[slug]` in the workspace. **Warning:** This bypasses built-in safeguards and carries a high risk of unexpected behavior. Use with extreme caution.
