# Roo Code 3.3.0 Release Notes

This release introduces native Code Actions, smarter mode switching, enhanced Markdown support for specific modes, and AWS profile support for Bedrock.

## Feature Highlights

*   **Code Actions Support:** Integrated native VS Code code actions for quick fixes and refactoring suggestions directly within the editor.
*   **Smarter Mode Switching:** Modes can now intelligently request switches to other modes when appropriate (e.g., suggesting Code mode when needing to edit code from Architect mode).
*   **Enhanced Markdown Support:** Ask and Architect modes now support editing Markdown files.
*   **Custom File Pattern Restrictions:** Added the ability to restrict custom modes to specific file patterns (e.g., allowing a "Technical Writer" mode to only edit `.md` files).
*   **AWS Profiles for Bedrock:** Added support for configuring the Bedrock provider using AWS Profiles, beneficial for SSO or integrations without long-term credentials.
