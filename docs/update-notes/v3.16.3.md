# Roo Code 3.16.3 Release Notes (2025-05-08)

This release reverts the Tailwind CSS migration (temporarily) to restore UI stability and adds Elixir file extension support to the language parser for enhanced code analysis.

## Misc Improvements
*   **Revert Tailwind Migration**: Restored the previous user interface by reverting the Tailwind CSS migration. This returns the UI to a familiar and stable state, resolving issues introduced by the migration and ensuring users see the interface as expected without unexpected layout or style changes.
*   **Add Elixir File Support in Language Parser**: Added support for Elixir (`.ex`, `.exs`) files in the language parser. This expands language support, allowing users to work with Elixir code seamlessly and enabling better code analysis for improved productivity. (thanks pfitz!)
