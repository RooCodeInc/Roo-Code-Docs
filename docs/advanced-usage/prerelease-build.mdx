# Prerelease Build

For users who want the latest features and updates, Roo Code offers prerelease builds. The primary prerelease build is **Roo Code Nightly**, which is automatically published whenever changes are merged into our main development branch.

**Note:** As prerelease software, these builds may occasionally include experimental features or bugs. They are best suited for users comfortable with testing cutting-edge software.

To install a prerelease build like Roo Code Nightly:

1.  Open VS Code.
2.  Access Extensions: Click the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar or press `Ctrl+Shift+X` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+X` (macOS).
3.  Search for "Roo Code Nightly" (or the specific prerelease build name).
4.  Select the prerelease extension (e.g., "Roo Code Nightly" by RooVeterinaryInc) and click **Install**.
    *   If you have the stable version of Roo Code installed, the Marketplace might show an option to "Switch to Pre-Release Version" for the Roo Code extension itself, or you might find "Roo Code Nightly" as a separate listing.
5.  Reload VS Code if prompted.

You can have both the stable version of Roo Code and a prerelease build (like Roo Code Nightly) installed simultaneously. However, it's generally recommended to enable only one at a time in your VS Code workspace to avoid potential conflicts or unexpected behavior.
