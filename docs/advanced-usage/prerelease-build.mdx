# Prerelease Build

For users who want the latest features and updates, Roo Code offers prerelease builds. The primary prerelease build is **Roo Code Nightly**, which is automatically published whenever changes are merged into our main development branch.

**Note:** As prerelease software, these builds may occasionally include experimental features or bugs. They are best suited for users comfortable with testing cutting-edge software.

To install Roo Code Nightly:

1.  Open VS Code.
2.  Access Extensions: Click the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar or press `Ctrl+Shift+X` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+X` (macOS).
3.  Search for "Roo Code Nightly".
4.  Select the prerelease extension (e.g., "Roo Code Nightly" by RooVeterinaryInc) and click **Install**.
5.  Reload VS Code if prompted.
