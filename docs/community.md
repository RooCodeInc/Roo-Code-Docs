## Memory Bank Project by [@GreatScottyMac](https://github.com/GreatScottyMac)

The [Roo Code Memory Bank](https://github.com/GreatScottyMac/roo-code-memory-bank) project solves a critical challenge in AI-assisted development: **maintaining context across sessions**. By providing a structured memory system integrated with VS Code, it ensures your AI assistant maintains a deep understanding of your project across sessions.

**Key Features**

- ðŸ§  **Persistent Context**: Remembers project details across sessions and maintains consistent understanding of your codebase
- ðŸ”„ **Smart Workflows**: Mode-based operation with automatic context switching and project-specific customization
- ðŸ“Š **Knowledge Management**: Structured documentation with technical decision tracking and automated progress monitoring

Check out the [Memory Bank project on GitHub](https://github.com/GreatScottyMac/roo-code-memory-bank) to get started!
