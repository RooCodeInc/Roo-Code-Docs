# Roo Code Dynamic Rules by cannuri

[View Project on GitHub](https://github.com/cannuri/roo-code-dynamic-rules)

Inspired by LangMem, this simple Rule allows you to define new rules and delete them on the fly simply by writing `RULE/NORULE: (your new rule)` in your message. Roo Code will then add it to or remove it from the `.clinerules` file. This way you can quickly define project specific rules on the fly and build them up step by step.
