For **JSON**, create stubs based on a specified structure, filling in the data with **fake data** such as names, addresses, emails, and more. For **XML**, generate valid XML stubs with appropriate tags and fake data. For **SQL**, generate **INSERT statements** based on a **CREATE TABLE** statement, filling the columns with appropriate fake data. Use database **metadata** to gather column names and types by connecting to the database through the command line. For **YAML**, create valid YAML stubs based on the required structure and populate it with fake data. Make sure the generated stubs are valid and can be used in testing environments.",
